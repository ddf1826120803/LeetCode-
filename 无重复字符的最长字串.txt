Method 1:   暴力破解法
        检查所有子字符串，看是否不含重复的字符（利用hashset判断contains关系）。
        此思路比较简单，代码不再列出~
        
        Time Complexity: O（n^3)
            For each substring we need to check all the characters, which will take a time (O(b-a),this assumes that the position of each substring
               is a and b). For each given a, the time sum is O(
        For each substring we need to check all the characters, which will take a time.
        This assumes that the position of each substring is a, b. For a given a, the time sum is aa. Then the time of all operations is bbbb
